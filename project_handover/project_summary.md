# Zenafs - Project Summary

## Overview
Zenafs is a comprehensive mental health platform designed to connect clients with therapists while fostering a supportive community environment. The platform offers a dual-sided marketplace (Clients & Therapists) with robust features for booking, session management, billing, and real-time communication.

## Core Value Proposition
- **For Clients**: Easy access to qualified therapists, secure booking/payments, private sessions, and a supportive community for anxiety, motherhood, etc.
- **For Therapists**: Dedicated dashboard to manage clients, appointments, notes (SOAP/DAP), billing, and expanded reach.

## Key Features
1.  **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Distinct dashboards and permissions for 'Client' and 'Therapist' roles.
2.  **Appointment Management**: Booking system with Stripe payment integration.
3.  **Clinical Notes**: Secure, standardized note-taking for therapists (SOAP, DAP, General).
4.  **Real-Time Chat**: Secure messaging between mapped clients and therapists.
5.  **Community Hub**: Group-based community features with gratitude tokens and posts.
6.  **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first, serene UI using Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion.

## Current Status
-   **Tech Stack**: Next.js 16 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, Supabase (Auth, DB, Realtime).
-   **Structure**: Basic scaffolding exists for dashboards, layout, and database schema.
-   **Missing**: Full implementation of logic for bookings, functional chat, community interactivity, and deeper role-based UI differentiation.
